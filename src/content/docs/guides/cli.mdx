This guide provides a detailed overview of the `zumito-cli` commands, helping you to streamline your development workflow.

## `create project`

This command initializes a new Zumito Framework project. It sets up the basic structure, dependencies, and configuration files to get you started quickly.

```bash
npx zumito-cli create project
```

This is the first command you should run when starting a new bot. For more information on setting up your project, see the [Quick Start Guide](/guides/start).

---

## `create command`

This command generates a new command file with boilerplate code, allowing you to quickly implement new functionalities for your bot.

```bash
npx zumito-cli create command
```

The CLI will prompt you for the command name and the module it belongs to. For a detailed explanation of how to build commands, refer to the [Create Command Guide](/guides/command).

## `create embedBuilder`

This command creates a new service class designed to build and manage message embeds. This is useful for creating visually appealing and structured messages.

```bash
npx zumito-cli create embedBuilder
```

Using an embed builder helps to keep your code clean and organized, especially for commands that send complex embeds.

---

## `create actionRowBuilder`

This command generates a service class for creating and managing action rows, which can contain buttons, select menus, and other interactive components.

```bash
npx zumito-cli create actionRowBuilder
```

Action rows are essential for creating interactive bots. You can learn more about handling interactions in the [Create Command Guide](/guides/command).

---

## `inject service`

This command simplifies the process of injecting a service into a class using the `ServiceContainer`. It automatically adds the necessary import statements and constructor code.

```bash
npx zumito-cli inject service
```

This command helps you to follow the dependency injection pattern, making your code more modular and testable. You can see an example of service injection in the [Create Command Guide](/guides/command#acces-to-discord-client-instance).
