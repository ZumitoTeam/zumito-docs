To start creating a command, you just need to run the following command:

```bash
npx zumito-cli create command
```

It will ask you for the name of the command, and the module where you want to create it.

<Aside>
    Don't worry if you don't created the module yet, the CLI will create it for you.
</Aside>

After that, it will create a file in the `src/modules/<module>/commands` folder with the name of the command.
The file will contain the following code:

```ts
import { Command, CommandParameters, ZumitoFramework, CommandType, SelectMenuParameters } from "zumito-framework";

export class CommandName extends Command {

    execute({ message, interaction, args, client, framework, guildSettings }: CommandParameters): void {
        // Command code
    }

    async selectMenu({ path, interaction, client, framework, guildSettings }: SelectMenuParameters): Promise<void> {
        
    }

}
```

From here, you can start coding your command.
- `execute` is the function that will be executed when the command is executed.
- `selectMenu` is the function that will be executed when a select menu is executed.

## Command parameters

The `execute` function receives a `CommandParameters` object, which contains the following properties:
- `message` - Discord.Message object. Undefined if the command is executed from an interaction (slash command).
- `interaction` - Discord.Interaction object. Undefined if the command is executed from a message with the prefix.
- `args` - Arguments of the command. Contains the arguments user passed to the command.

    - You can get the arguments using the `get` method, which receives the name of the argument and the type of the argument.

        ```ts
        args.get("argumentName"); // Output: "Argument value"
        ```
    - Output comes in the type you specified, so if you specify a number, the output will be a number and if you specify a user it will be a Discord.User object.
- `client` - Discord.Client object.
- `framework` - ZumitoFramework object.
- `guildSettings` - Guild settings object. Contains the settings of the guild where the command was executed. The data is loaded from the database on each command execution.
- `trans` - A shorthand function to translate strings. It receives the key of the string and the variables to replace in the string.
    - It does not require language to be specified, it will use the language of the guild where the command was executed.
    - The key is relative to current command, so if you have a key named `command.yourCommandName.yourKey`, you can use it like this: `trans("yourKey")`. if you want to use a key from anywhere else, you can use `$` prefix, like this: `trans("$command.yourCommandName.yourKey")`.
