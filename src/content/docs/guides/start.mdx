This guide will help you to quickly start developing a new bot using zumito-framework.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18 or higher)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)


- Discord Bot **Token**, you can get one [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
- Discord Bot **Client ID**, you can get one [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
- Discord Bot **Client Secret**, you can get one [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications)

## Setup

First, create a new project using the [Zumito CLI](http://www.npmjs.com/package/zumito-cli) or by interactive web wizard

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Command Line" icon="cli">
```bash
npx zumito-cli create project
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Wizard" icon="wizard">
    <Test/>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


It will clone the template project, install the dependencies and configure the `.env` file by asking you some questions.
Database config will be saved to the `.env` file. You can change it later if you want.
- **Tingodb** is recommended for **development** since it doesn't require any external database, it will save the data in a file.
- **MongoDB** is recommended for **production** for better performance. 

<Aside>You can find more information about the `.env` file [here](/docs/bot/env).</Aside>

## Development

Once the project is configured, you can start creating a module for your bot.
Here is a list of things you may want to do:
- [Create a command](/docs/custom/create-command)
- [Listen to event](/docs/custom/create-event)
- [Create a model](/docs/custom/create-model)

## Run the bot

To execute the bot, run:

```bash
npm run start
```
