This guide will help you to quickly start developing a new bot using zumito-framework.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18 or higher)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)


- Discord Bot **Token**, you can get one [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
- Discord Bot **Client ID**, you can get one [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
- Discord Bot **Client Secret**, you can get one [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications)

## Setup

<Steps>
  1. Create a new project
      <Tabs>
        <TabItem label="Command Line" icon="cli">
      ```bash
      npx zumito-cli create project
      ```
        </TabItem>
        <TabItem label="Wizard" icon="wizard">
          <CreateProject client:only="svelte"/>
        </TabItem>
      </Tabs>

  2. Start the bot
      ```bash
      npm run dev
      ```
</Steps>

It will clone the template project, install the dependencies and configure the `.env` file by asking you some questions.

Database config will be saved to the `.env` file. You can change it later if you want.
- **Tingodb** is recommended for **development** since it doesn't require any external database, it will save the data in a file.
- **MongoDB** is recommended for **production** for better performance. 

<Aside>You can find more information about the `.env` file [here](/docs/bot/env).</Aside>

Your bot's configuration is located in the `zumito.config.ts` file. Here you can define your bot's bundles and other configurations.

## Next steps

Once the project is configured, you can start creating a module for your bot.
Here is a list of things you may want to do:
<LinkCard
  title="Create a command"
  description="Start creating commands for your bot"
  href="/guides/command"
/>

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard
    title="Listen to an event"
    description="Execute a piece of code when some event ocurs"
    href="/guides/event"
  />
</CardGrid>
